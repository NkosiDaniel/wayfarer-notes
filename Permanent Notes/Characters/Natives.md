*The natives were once people who lived on the surface with the rest of civilization until the Great Titan War devastated their country and the minor moon fell from the sky towards the Dungeons. The Natives were driven out from the surface by the others and by the belief that their Moon Goddess had called them towards the Seven Dungeons.* - **Torn Page**

There are two nations of Natives that didn't escape to the Dungeons. They soon assimilated with the rest of civilization and lost their pure identities. These two tribes became the basis of the Divine Empire which adopted the state religion of the **Nine Heavens**.
