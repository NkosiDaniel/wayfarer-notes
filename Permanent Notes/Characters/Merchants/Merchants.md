[[Characters]]
The Merchants, mostly think about profit and will circumvent from danger.

*You know, many merchants were initially natives who traded their knowledge of the Seven Dungeons for resources, they held knowledge of locations to either rooms of riches or shortcuts to other areas, I was even friends with some but, there has been an increasing amount of locals from above selling handy items to voyagers.* -- **Marco**

*Furthermore, there are now people called [[Reconnoiters]] who specialize in creating glossaries of the dungeon layout thus squashing the trading between natives and voyagers. I guess the natives didnâ€™t like that so they went into hiding, thinking they were no longer needed.  -- **Marco**
